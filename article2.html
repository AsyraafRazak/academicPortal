        <h2>1. Start Early</h2>
        <p>Don’t wait until the last minute to study. Starting early allows you to break down your study material and reduces the pressure of cramming.</p>

        <h2>2. Create a Study Plan</h2>
        <p>Outline the subjects and topics you need to review and set a timeline for each. This will help you allocate sufficient time for each subject based on its difficulty.</p>

        <h2>3. Organize Your Study Materials</h2>
        <p>Gather all your lecture notes, textbooks, past papers, and any other relevant materials. Organize them by topic and make sure they’re easily accessible during your study sessions.</p>

        <h2>4. Take Practice Tests</h2>
        <p>Practice tests can help you familiarize yourself with the format of the exam and identify areas where you need to improve. Use past exam papers or online quizzes.</p>

        <h2>5. Focus on Understanding, Not Memorization</h2>
        <p>Rather than simply memorizing facts, aim to understand the material. This will make it easier to apply your knowledge during the exam and retain the information longer.</p>

        <h2>6. Use Active Learning Techniques</h2>
        <p>Engage with the material through active learning techniques like summarizing, teaching someone else, or creating flashcards for important concepts.</p>

        <h2>7. Take Breaks</h2>
        <p>Study in focused intervals with regular breaks to avoid burnout. Follow the Pomodoro technique (study for 25 minutes, break for 5 minutes). This will help you retain information better.</p>

        <h2>8. Get Enough Sleep</h2>
        <p>Sleep is essential for memory retention and mental clarity. Avoid staying up all night studying, as it can hurt your performance during the exam.</p>

        <h2>9. Stay Positive and Confident</h2>
        <p>A positive mindset helps reduce exam anxiety and boosts your performance. Believe in your preparation and stay calm during the exam.</p>

        <h2>10. Review and Relax Before the Exam</h2>
        <p>On the day before the exam, review the key points, relax, and avoid any new study material. A clear and calm mind will help you perform your best.</p>
