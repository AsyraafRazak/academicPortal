        <h2>1. Prioritize Your Tasks</h2>
        <p>Start by identifying the most important tasks that need to be done and focus on those first. This ensures that you're spending your time on what truly matters.</p>

        <h2>2. Break Your Work into Manageable Pieces</h2>
        <p>Instead of looking at an overwhelming assignment as a whole, break it down into smaller, more manageable sections. This will make it easier to start and make steady progress.</p>

        <h2>3. Set Specific Goals</h2>
        <p>Setting clear and specific goals for each day, week, and month helps you stay on track. Make sure your goals are realistic and measurable.</p>

        <h2>4. Use a Planner or Digital Calendar</h2>
        <p>Keeping track of your assignments, exams, and meetings with a planner or digital calendar is a great way to avoid missing deadlines and managing your commitments effectively.</p>

        <h2>5. Minimize Distractions</h2>
        <p>To stay focused, eliminate distractions. Turn off notifications, keep your workspace organized, and try to create a quiet environment conducive to studying.</p>

        <h2>6. Use the Pomodoro Technique</h2>
        <p>This time management technique involves working for 25-minute intervals followed by a 5-minute break. After four intervals, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes.</p>

        <h2>7. Take Care of Your Health</h2>
        <p>Your physical and mental health are crucial for effective time management. Be sure to exercise regularly, eat healthy, and get plenty of sleep to stay energized and productive.</p>

        <h2>8. Learn to Say No</h2>
        <p>It’s important to recognize when you’re overcommitted. Politely decline additional responsibilities that may interfere with your academic or personal goals.</p>

        <h2>9. Review and Reflect Regularly</h2>
        <p>At the end of each week, reflect on what you’ve accomplished and assess your goals for the next week. This helps you make adjustments as needed to stay on track.</p>

        <h2>10. Stay Consistent</h2>
        <p>The key to mastering time management is consistency. Stick to your schedule and keep working towards your goals every day.</p>
