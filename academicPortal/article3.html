        <h2>1. Prioritize Your Time</h2>
        <p>Start by assessing your academic and extracurricular commitments and prioritize them. Understand when deadlines and events are coming up to better manage your time.</p>

        <h2>2. Plan Your Schedule</h2>
        <p>Use a planner or calendar to block out time for both studying and extracurricular activities. Make sure to leave time for rest and self-care.</p>

        <h2>3. Focus on Quality Over Quantity</h2>
        <p>Rather than trying to do everything, focus on the extracurricular activities that truly interest you and align with your academic goals.</p>

        <h2>4. Learn to Say No</h2>
        <p>It’s okay to turn down activities if you feel overwhelmed. Prioritize what’s most important to you and your long-term goals.</p>

        <h2>5. Use Your Free Time Wisely</h2>
        <p>Make the most of your free time to catch up on studying or to prepare for upcoming extracurricular events. Stay organized to prevent unnecessary stress.</p>

        <h2>6. Delegate Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>If you’re involved in student organizations or teams, learn to delegate tasks to others. This will help you balance your workload without overloading yourself.</p>

        <h2>7. Take Care of Yourself</h2>
        <p>Balancing academics and extracurricular activities can be demanding, so don’t forget to take time to relax, exercise, and socialize.</p>

        <h2>8. Stay Flexible</h2>
        <p>Things don’t always go as planned, so be flexible and adjust your schedule when needed. Life is unpredictable, and adaptability is key to maintaining balance.</p>

        <h2>9. Set Realistic Expectations</h2>
        <p>Be realistic about what you can achieve. Setting unattainable goals will only lead to frustration and burnout.</p>

        <h2>10. Remember Your Long-Term Goals</h2>
        <p>Always keep your long-term goals in mind. Whether it’s graduation, career development, or personal growth, balancing your time effectively will help you get there.</p>
